# Michael-s-Arduino-libs
 
1. All files, function and symbo names are initilzed with MIC_
2. MIC_GeneralDef.h provides basic data type definitions and other supporting data structures I got used to.
3. All lib are developed for my own Arduino projects. I will try to make them compatible to other implementations and test as much as possible.

A. LCD
This lib contains basic funciton for (16x1, 16x2, 16x3 and 16x4) LCD display. I don't like the way others are doing for example, adding too many delays instead of using busy flags, lack of optimization or source structure etc.
