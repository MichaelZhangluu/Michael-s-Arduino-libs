# Michael-s-Arduino-libs
 
1. All files, function and symbo names have a prefix as "MIC_"
2. MIC_GeneralDef.h provides basic data type definitions and other supporting data structures I got used to.
3. All lib are developed for my own Arduino projects. I will try to make them compatible to other implementations and test as much as possible.

A. LCD
This lib contains basic funciton for (16x1, 16x2, 16x3 and 16x4) LCD display. I'm in development of I2C(2WI) libs that will support I2C extention card for LCD modules.
